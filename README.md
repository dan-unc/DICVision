# Overview
We are trying to speed up DIC using deep learning.

We've decided to use the package muDIC for the explorations. 

## Folder Description
* "A_learnings.py" : short scripts for learning what is going on.

# Programming Conventions

## Tagging System
* All the code will be in different directories. Each directory will be tagged with a capital letter (A-Z, then AA, AB, and so on). For eg., "A_learnings".
* Each script inside these folders will be tagged by a small letter (a-b, then aa, ab, and so on). For eg., "a_task1.py".
* Any figure or dataset generated from a script should have the tags of both the script itself and the directory. For example, figures outputted from a file "A_learnings/a_task1.py" should be tagged as "Aa_fig1.png", "Aa_fig2.png", etc.
